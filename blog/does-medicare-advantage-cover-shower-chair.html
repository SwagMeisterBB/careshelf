    <p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mb-10">Published February 28, 2026 by AdvantageGuide Editorial Team</p>

    <article class="prose">

      <p>Yes, Medicare Advantage covers shower chairs and bath benches. Depending on your plan, a shower chair may be covered under the <strong>DME (Durable Medical Equipment) benefit</strong>, the <strong>Home Safety benefit</strong>, or both. Most members can get one at little or no cost, but the majority never ask about it and pay out of pocket unnecessarily.</p>

      <h2>Which Medicare Advantage Benefit Covers a Shower Chair?</h2>

      <p>Shower chairs can fall under two different benefits depending on your plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DME benefit:</strong> Covers shower chairs when your doctor prescribes one as medically necessary, for example, after a hip replacement, knee surgery, or for a patient with significant balance deficits or COPD.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Safety benefit:</strong> Covers shower chairs as part of your annual home safety allowance, without requiring a physician prescription in most cases. This is the more commonly used route for members who are not post-surgical but still benefit from a shower seat.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Call Member Services and ask about both. Some plans will cover a shower chair under whichever benefit you qualify for.</p>

      <h2>Does Medicare Advantage Cover a Walk-In Shower Bench Too?</h2>

      <p>Yes. A transfer bench, which straddles the tub edge so you can sit down outside the tub and slide in, is also covered under most plans. Transfer benches are often recommended over standard shower chairs for patients who have difficulty stepping over a tub wall, including many post-hip and post-knee replacement patients.</p>

      <p>Both shower chairs and transfer benches fall within the same benefit category. Ask your doctor which type is more appropriate for your specific situation.</p>

      <h2>What Does a Shower Chair Cost Without Coverage?</h2>

      <p>A quality shower chair typically costs <strong>$35 to $75 out of pocket</strong>. If your plan covers it, the cost to you is usually zero or a small copay. Either way, a shower chair is one of the highest-value safety investments per dollar for anyone with balance or mobility concerns.</p>

      <h2>How to Get a Shower Chair Covered: 3 Steps</h2>

      <p><strong>Step 1: Call Member Services.</strong> Call the number on the back of your insurance card. Ask: "Do I have a Home Safety benefit or DME coverage for a shower chair or bath bench? What do I need to do to get one covered?" Note the benefit name and allowance amount they give you.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Get a doctor's order if required.</strong> If your plan routes shower chairs through the DME benefit, you will need a physician prescription. Call your doctor's office and ask them to submit a DME order for a shower chair. For most patients, this takes one phone call and does not require an office visit.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Use an approved vendor or self-purchase.</strong> Some plans work with approved DME suppliers who deliver the chair to your home. Others allow you to purchase one yourself and submit a receipt for reimbursement up to your allowance amount. Ask Member Services which method your plan uses.</p>

      <h2>Can You Get a Shower Chair at Discharge From the Hospital?</h2>

      <p>Yes, and this is the easiest time. Before you leave the hospital or rehab facility, ask the discharge coordinator: "Can you put in an order for a shower chair?" It is one of the most commonly ordered items at discharge, and most plans can arrange delivery before you arrive home.</p>

      <p>Occupational therapists on the hospital team will often recommend a shower chair as part of your discharge plan. If one hasn't been mentioned and you have any balance concerns, ask about it proactively.</p>

      <h2>Should You Use a Shower Chair With a Handheld Shower Head?</h2>

      <p>Yes. A shower chair is most effective when paired with a handheld shower head with an extended hose. This lets you direct water while seated without twisting or reaching. A handheld shower head is also often covered under the Home Safety benefit. The two items together cost less than $100 and make a significant difference in both safety and independence.</p>

      <h2>What About Non-Slip Bath Mats?</h2>

      <p>Non-slip bath mats are also covered under most Home Safety benefits and are typically available through your plan's OTC catalog as well. A non-slip mat inside the tub or shower, paired with a shower chair, covers the two most common slip-and-fall scenarios in the bathroom.</p>
