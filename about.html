    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">We help Medicare Advantage members discover and claim the home health benefits their plans already cover.</p>

    <!-- About AdvantageGuide -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Most Medicare Advantage members are sitting on benefits they never use. Their plans include allowances for over-the-counter health products, home safety modifications like grab bars and shower chairs, and durable medical equipment coverage that can save hundreds of dollars a year. But the information is buried in dense plan documents, and no one tells members what they have or how to use it.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">AdvantageGuide exists to fix that.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Founded by Austin Edy, AdvantageGuide is built on a simple idea: if you are paying for a Medicare Advantage plan, you should actually get everything it covers. We research the benefits, explain them in plain language, and show you the exact steps to claim them. No jargon. No confusion. Just clear answers about what your plan pays for and how to get it.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Whether it is your OTC allowance, a home safety benefit, or DME coverage after a surgery, we want every member to know what is available to them and feel confident using it.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Austin writes every guide on AdvantageGuide. His focus is making Medicare benefits accessible and understandable for the people who need them most. That means skipping the insurance industry jargon and writing the way you would explain something to a friend or family member.</p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Every article is built around one question: what does your plan actually cover, and what do you need to do to claim it? Austin researches official plan documents, benefit summaries, and Medicare.gov resources so that the answers you find here are accurate, specific, and useful.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Editorial Standards</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">We hold ourselves to a high standard because the information we publish affects real decisions about health and money. Here is how we work:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Researched from primary sources.</strong> All content is based on official plan documents, Summary of Benefits materials, and Medicare.gov. We do not rely on secondhand information or unverified claims.</li>
        <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Reviewed for accuracy.</strong> Every guide is reviewed for factual accuracy before publication. We check benefit details, coverage amounts, and claiming procedures against current plan information.</li>
        <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Updated regularly.</strong> Medicare Advantage benefits change from year to year. We revisit and update our guides as plans release new benefit structures so the information stays current.</li>
        <li class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Written in plain language.</strong> We believe that if a member cannot understand the explanation, the explanation has failed. Every guide is written to be clear to someone with no background in insurance or healthcare policy.</li>
