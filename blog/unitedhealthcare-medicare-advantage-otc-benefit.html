    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>UnitedHealthcare (UHC) Medicare Advantage plans, including plans sold under the AARP MedicareComplete brand, include an <a href="/blog/what-is-medicare-advantage-otc-benefit.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">OTC benefit</a> that gives you a quarterly allowance to buy everyday health and wellness products at no cost to you. Most UHC plans provide between <strong>$50 and $150 per quarter</strong> in OTC funds, loaded onto a card called the Healthy Benefits+ card. This guide explains exactly how the benefit works and how to make the most of it.</p>

      <div class="my-6 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-5">
        <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-1">Important Disclaimer</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Benefits vary by specific UnitedHealthcare plan and county. The information below reflects common features across many UHC plans, but your plan may differ. Always call Member Services at the number printed on the back of your UHC card or log into myuhc.com to confirm your exact benefit amount and which items are covered.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is the UHC OTC Benefit?</h2>
      <p>The OTC benefit is a prepaid quarterly allowance that UnitedHealthcare adds to your Healthy Benefits+ card. You use this card at approved stores or online to purchase eligible health products without spending any of your own money. The card is separate from your standard UHC insurance card. Keep both cards in your wallet so you always have them available when you shop. The benefit is one of the most used supplemental perks in Medicare Advantage because it pays for items you would otherwise buy out of pocket every month.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does UnitedHealthcare Give for OTC?</h2>
      <p>Most UHC Medicare Advantage plans load between <strong>$50 and $150 per quarter</strong> onto your Healthy Benefits+ card. Some plans reset monthly rather than quarterly, depending on the specific plan design. Check your plan's Evidence of Coverage or call Member Services to find out your exact amount and reset schedule. Unused funds do not carry over at the end of the benefit period, so using your full balance before the reset date is important.</p>

      <h2>How to Check Your UHC OTC Balance</h2>
      <p>You have two convenient ways to check your current Healthy Benefits+ balance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Log into myuhc.com:</strong> Sign in to your member account and look for the supplemental benefits or OTC benefit section on your dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Member Services:</strong> The phone number is printed on the back of your UHC insurance card. A representative can tell you your current balance and which items qualify.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also check your balance at checkout in many stores, or through the Healthy Benefits+ website at healthybenefitsplus.com.</p>

      <h2>Where Can You Use Your Healthy Benefits+ Card In-Store?</h2>
      <p>UnitedHealthcare's Healthy Benefits+ card is accepted at a broad network of retail stores. Common approved locations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walmart</li>
        <li>CVS Pharmacy</li>
        <li>Walgreens</li>
        <li>Kroger and affiliated grocery stores</li>
        <li>Dollar General (in many markets)</li>
        <li>Rite Aid (in some markets)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At checkout, swipe or tap your Healthy Benefits+ card just like a debit card. The system automatically approves eligible items and declines ineligible ones. If you have a mix of covered and non-covered items in your cart, simply pay for the ineligible items separately.</p>

      <h2>How to Order OTC Items Online</h2>
      <p>UHC members can also order OTC products online through the Healthy Benefits+ portal or through the myuhc.com member portal. Online ordering is a great option if you have limited mobility or prefer the convenience of home delivery. To order online:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to healthybenefitsplus.com or log into myuhc.com.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the OTC or supplemental benefits section.</li>
        <li>Browse the catalog and add eligible items to your cart.</li>
        <li>Complete checkout using your OTC allowance balance.</li>
        <li>Items ship to your home, usually within a few business days, at no extra cost.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What Does the UHC OTC Benefit Cover?</h2>
      <p>The covered item list varies by plan, but most UnitedHealthcare OTC benefits include products in these categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health monitoring:</strong> Blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, thermometers, glucose testing supplies</li>
        <li><strong>First aid:</strong> Bandages, gauze, antiseptic wipes, wound care supplies</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamins and supplements:</strong> Multivitamins, vitamin D, fish oil, calcium</li>
        <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, denture care products</li>
        <li><strong>Eye care:</strong> Reading glasses, lubricating eye drops, lens cleaning solutions</li>
        <li><strong>Foot care:</strong> Insoles, antifungal treatments, foot creams</li>
        <li><strong>Compression socks and garments</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pain relief:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers, TENS units, heating pads</li>
        <li><strong>Incontinence supplies</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The UHC Healthy Foods Benefit: A Bonus for Some Members</h2>
      <p>Some UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plans go a step further by including a <strong>Healthy Foods benefit</strong> in addition to the standard OTC allowance. This benefit provides a separate allowance specifically for purchasing fresh produce, proteins, and other nutritious grocery items at participating stores. If your plan includes this feature, you may find it loaded onto the same Healthy Benefits+ card as a separate balance. Ask Member Services whether your specific plan includes a Healthy Foods allowance and how much it provides.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Maximize Your UHC OTC Benefit</h2>
      <p>Getting the full value of your quarterly OTC allowance takes a little planning. Set a calendar reminder for the final week of each benefit period so you do not forget to shop before unused funds disappear. Make a list of health items you regularly purchase, such as vitamins, blood pressure monitoring supplies, or compression socks, and check whether they qualify. Stocking up on non-perishable eligible items near the end of each period is a smart way to make sure nothing goes to waste. Use AdvantageGuide to quickly identify which specific products your UHC plan covers and get step-by-step instructions for ordering or claiming them.</p>
