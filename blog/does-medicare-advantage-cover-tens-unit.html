    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>Yes, TENS units are available through many Medicare Advantage <a href="/blog/what-is-medicare-advantage-otc-benefit.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">OTC benefit</a> catalogs. A TENS unit, short for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, is a small, battery-powered device that delivers mild electrical pulses through electrode pads placed on the skin to relieve pain. Many plans list TENS units under "pain relief" or "pain management" in their approved product catalog, and you can purchase one using your OTC benefit card at no additional cost if your allowance covers it.</p>

      <h2>What Is a TENS Unit and How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>A TENS unit is a handheld device about the size of a TV remote. It connects to self-adhesive electrode pads that you place directly on the skin near the area of pain. When activated, the unit sends low-voltage electrical pulses that travel through the skin to the nerves underneath.</p>
      <p>These pulses work in two main ways. First, they may interfere with pain signals traveling to the brain, which is sometimes called the "gate control" theory of pain relief. Second, they may stimulate the body to release endorphins, which are natural pain-relieving chemicals. Most users feel a gentle tingling or buzzing sensation during use, not discomfort.</p>
      <p>Sessions typically last 15 to 30 minutes and can be repeated multiple times throughout the day depending on your needs and the device instructions.</p>

      <h2>What Types of Pain Can a TENS Unit Help With?</h2>
      <p>TENS therapy is used for a variety of common pain conditions, many of which affect older adults regularly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arthritis pain:</strong> Knee, hip, hand, and shoulder joint pain</li>
        <li><strong>Lower back pain:</strong> One of the most common uses for home TENS units</li>
        <li><strong>Neck and shoulder pain:</strong> Including tension and muscle tightness</li>
        <li><strong>Muscle soreness:</strong> After activity or prolonged sitting</li>
        <li><strong>Neuropathy:</strong> Nerve pain in the feet or legs related to diabetes or other conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Post-surgical pain:</strong> During recovery, with doctor guidance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TENS therapy does not treat the underlying cause of pain, but it can provide meaningful relief and reduce dependence on oral pain medications for some people.</p>

      <h2>Home TENS Units vs. Clinical TENS Devices</h2>
      <p>The TENS units available through OTC benefit catalogs are consumer-grade devices designed for home use. They differ from clinical TENS machines used by physical therapists in a few important ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Home units operate at lower intensity levels, which makes them safer for unsupervised use</li>
        <li>They are smaller, simpler, and easier to operate without training</li>
        <li>They typically come with pre-set modes rather than fully adjustable clinical settings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For most everyday pain management at home, consumer-grade units provide good results. If you have more complex pain needs or want to learn proper electrode placement for a specific condition, a session with a physical therapist can be helpful before beginning home use.</p>

      <h2>How to Find a TENS Unit in Your OTC Catalog</h2>
      <p>To check whether your plan covers a TENS unit:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Log in to your plan's member portal</strong> and navigate to the OTC benefit section, or call Member Services and ask about your OTC allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Search the catalog</strong> for "TENS," "TENS unit," "pain relief device," or "electrical stimulation." Some plans categorize it under "pain management" or "physical therapy aids."</li>
        <li><strong>Check the brands listed.</strong> Common OTC-catalog brands include iReliev, TechCare, and Omron. iReliev in particular is widely stocked across multiple major plan catalogs.</li>
        <li><strong>Order using your OTC benefit card</strong> online, by phone, or at an approved retail location.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>OTC allowances often reset quarterly, so if you have not used your full balance recently, a TENS unit is a practical way to put those funds to work.</p>

      <h2>Safety Guidelines for Home TENS Use</h2>
      <p>Home TENS units are safe for most adults when used as directed. However, there are important situations where you should not use a TENS unit without speaking to your doctor first:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pacemaker or implanted electrical device:</strong> The electrical pulses can interfere with pacemakers and defibrillators. Do not use a TENS unit if you have one.</li>
        <li><strong>Epilepsy:</strong> Electrical stimulation may trigger seizures in some people.</li>
        <li><strong>Open wounds or broken skin:</strong> Do not place electrode pads on or near any broken skin, rash, or wound.</li>
        <li><strong>Head or face:</strong> Never place pads on your head, face, throat, or over your eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Avoid use during pregnancy unless specifically approved by a doctor.</li>
        <li><strong>Numb areas:</strong> If you have significant numbness from neuropathy, use caution since you may not be able to feel if the intensity is too high.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always start at the lowest intensity setting and increase gradually. The sensation should be noticeable but never painful.</p>

      <h2>What Other OTC Pain Relief Items May Be Covered?</h2>
      <p>If your plan covers a TENS unit, it may also cover related pain management items through the OTC benefit. Some plans include heating pads, cold packs, topical analgesic creams, and compression wraps in the same catalog. Reviewing your full product list can help you find additional tools for managing chronic pain without additional out-of-pocket cost.</p>
