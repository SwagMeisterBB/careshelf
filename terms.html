    <article class="prose">

      <p>Welcome to AdvantageGuide (advantageguide.health). By using our website, you agree to the following terms. We have written them in plain language so they are easy to understand.</p>

      <h2>Informational Use Only -- Not Medical Advice</h2>

      <p>Everything on AdvantageGuide is for <strong>general informational purposes only</strong>. Our guides, articles, and product recommendations are not medical advice, healthcare advice, or insurance advice. They are not a substitute for professional judgment from your doctor, nurse, therapist, or any member of your care team.</p>

      <p>Do not make medical decisions based solely on what you read here. If you have questions about your health, a medical condition, or whether a particular product is safe for you, please talk to your healthcare provider before making any changes.</p>

      <h2>Always Consult Your Care Team and Plan</h2>

      <p>Before purchasing any product or requesting any benefit described on this site, we strongly recommend that you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Talk to your doctor or care team</strong> to confirm the product is appropriate for your situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Call your plan's Member Services number</strong> (printed on the back of your insurance card) to confirm what your specific plan covers, how much it covers, and what steps are required to get reimbursed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your care team and your plan's Member Services representatives are the only people who can give you definitive answers about what is right for you and what your plan will pay for.</p>

      <h2>Benefits Vary by Plan, Year, and Location</h2>

      <p>Medicare Advantage plans differ significantly from one another. The benefits, dollar amounts, covered products, and claiming processes we describe on this site are <strong>general summaries based on common plan designs</strong>. Your specific plan may cover more, less, or different items than what we describe.</p>

      <p>Coverage also changes from year to year. A benefit that exists in your plan this year may be modified or removed next year, and new benefits may be added. What is available in one state or county may not be available in another.</p>

      <p>Always verify your current benefits directly with your plan before relying on the information we provide.</p>

      <h2>No Guarantee of Coverage</h2>

      <p>AdvantageGuide does not guarantee that any product, service, or benefit described on our site is covered by your particular Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage depends entirely on your individual plan, your plan year, your location, and the specific terms of your plan's Summary of Benefits and Evidence of Coverage documents.</p>

      <p>If we say that "most plans cover" a particular item, that is a general statement based on our review of commonly available plans. It does not mean your plan covers it. The only way to confirm coverage is to contact your plan directly.</p>

      <h2>Amazon Affiliate Disclosure</h2>

      <p>AdvantageGuide is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

      <p>When you click a product link on our site and make a purchase on Amazon, we may earn a small commission. This comes at no additional cost to you. The price you pay on Amazon is the same whether you arrive through our link or go directly to Amazon.</p>

      <p>Our product recommendations are based on what we believe is most helpful for Medicare Advantage members. Earning a commission does not influence which products we recommend. We only feature products that are commonly covered under Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits and that have strong reviews from real users.</p>

      <h2>Accuracy and Updates</h2>

      <p>We do our best to keep the information on AdvantageGuide accurate and up to date. We research plan benefits carefully and update our guides when plan details change. However, Medicare Advantage plans are updated by insurers regularly, and we cannot guarantee that every detail on our site reflects the most current version of every plan.</p>

      <p>If you notice something that appears to be outdated or incorrect, we would appreciate hearing from you so we can review and correct it.</p>

      <h2>Use of Our Website</h2>

      <p>You are welcome to use AdvantageGuide for your personal, non-commercial reference. You may share links to our pages with friends, family members, or caregivers. Please do not copy or republish our content on other websites without our written permission.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>AdvantageGuide provides this website and its content on an "as is" basis. We make no warranties about the completeness, reliability, or accuracy of the information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, AdvantageGuide is not liable for any losses or damages arising from your use of our site or your reliance on any information we provide.</p>

      <p>This includes, but is not limited to, any out-of-pocket costs you incur for products that your plan does not end up covering, or any health outcomes related to products mentioned on our site.</p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

      <p>We may update these terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the site after any changes means you accept the updated terms.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>

      <p>If you have questions about these terms, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@advantageguide.health" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">hello@advantageguide.health</a>.</p>
