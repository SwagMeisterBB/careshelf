    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>Yes, non-slip bath mats are covered by many Medicare Advantage plans under the Home Safety or Home Modification benefit. Because non-slip mats are among the least expensive items in the home safety category, they are easy to cover within your plan's annual allowance. Some plans also include them in the OTC benefit catalog under bath safety items. Either way, you may be able to get one at little or no cost.</p>

      <h2>Why Non-Slip Bath Mats Matter for Fall Prevention</h2>
      <p>Falls in the bathroom are the leading cause of home injury in adults over 65. Wet, smooth surfaces in bathtubs, showers, and on bathroom floors create a high-risk environment, especially for people with balance issues, reduced leg strength, or conditions like neuropathy or arthritis that affect stability.</p>
      <p>A non-slip bath mat is one of the simplest and most effective changes you can make to reduce fall risk. It takes minutes to put in place, requires no installation, and can prevent a serious injury that might otherwise lead to hospitalization or surgery. Many falls that happen in the bathroom could be prevented with this one low-cost item.</p>

      <h2>What Types of Non-Slip Mats Are Covered?</h2>
      <p>Medicare Advantage home safety benefits typically cover two main types of non-slip mats for the bathroom:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tub and shower mats:</strong> These sit inside the bathtub or shower floor and grip the surface with suction cups on the underside. They provide traction under wet feet, which dramatically reduces the risk of slipping during bathing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bathroom floor mats:</strong> These sit just outside the tub or shower on the bathroom floor and prevent slipping on wet tile or linoleum when stepping out. Look for mats with non-skid rubber backings rather than decorative rugs, which can slide.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both types are commonly listed in home safety benefit catalogs. If your plan covers bath safety through the OTC benefit instead, search the catalog under "bath safety" or "<a href="/blog/medicare-advantage-fall-prevention-benefits.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">fall prevention</a>."</p>

      <h2>How Much Do Non-Slip Bath Mats Cost?</h2>
      <p>Non-slip bath mats are one of the most affordable home safety items available. Suction-cup tub mats typically cost $15 to $30. Bathroom floor mats with non-skid backs are in a similar price range. Because both are inexpensive relative to most plan allowances, you can often cover one or more mats without significantly reducing the allowance available for other items like <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-grab-bars.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">grab bars</a> or a <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-shower-chair.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">shower chair</a>.</p>
      <p>Even plans with modest home safety allowances of $100 to $250 per year can comfortably cover a non-slip mat. Plans with larger allowances of $500 to $1,500 may be able to cover a full set of bathroom safety equipment in a single benefit period.</p>

      <h2>How to Claim a Non-Slip Bath Mat Through Your Plan</h2>
      <p>The process for getting a non-slip bath mat covered is straightforward:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Call Member Services</strong> using the number on the back of your insurance card. Ask about the Home Safety benefit or Home Modification allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask how much allowance you have available</strong> and whether bath mats are listed as covered items under your specific plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Find an approved vendor.</strong> Your plan may have a list of approved suppliers, or it may allow you to purchase from any retailer and submit a reimbursement form.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the OTC catalog too.</strong> Some plans route bath safety items through the OTC benefit rather than the home safety benefit. Check both places.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your receipt</strong> in case you need to submit a reimbursement claim.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What to Look for When Choosing a Non-Slip Bath Mat</h2>
      <p>Not all bath mats provide the same level of safety. When selecting one, consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong suction cups:</strong> For tub mats, press the suction cups firmly against a clean, dry surface before getting in. The mat should not lift or shift when you apply your full body weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Full coverage:</strong> A larger mat that covers most of the tub floor provides more protection than a small decorative mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Textured surface:</strong> Look for mats with raised ridges, nubs, or a textured pattern that grips wet feet effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Mold and mildew resistance:</strong> Mats that dry quickly and resist mold are easier to maintain and last longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine washable:</strong> Easy-to-wash mats stay cleaner and safer over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Replace your bath mat when the suction cups no longer grip firmly or when the surface texture begins to wear smooth. A worn mat provides little protection and may give a false sense of security.</p>

      <h2>Pair Your Bath Mat with Other Covered Safety Items</h2>
      <p>A non-slip mat works best as part of a complete bathroom safety setup. If your plan's home safety allowance has room after purchasing a bath mat, consider using the remaining balance for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grab bars:</strong> Installed near the toilet, shower entrance, or inside the tub for support when sitting down, standing up, or stepping over the tub edge</li>
        <li><strong>A shower chair or bench:</strong> For sitting safely during bathing, especially useful after surgery or for people with limited stamina</li>
        <li><strong>A threshold ramp:</strong> To eliminate the raised lip at the shower entrance that can catch a foot</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These items address different fall hazards in the bathroom and together provide much greater protection than any single item alone. Many plans allow you to combine multiple home safety items within one annual allowance.</p>

      <h2>What If Your Plan Does Not Include a Home Safety Benefit?</h2>
      <p>Not all Medicare Advantage plans offer a dedicated home safety benefit. If yours does not, check your OTC benefit catalog before purchasing a bath mat on your own. Many plans include bath safety items under the OTC allowance, even if they do not have a separate home safety category. A non-slip bath mat is inexpensive enough that even a modest OTC balance can cover it easily.</p>
      <p>If neither benefit covers bath mats in your plan, the cost is low enough that purchasing one out of pocket is still worthwhile. A $20 mat is a small investment compared to the cost of a fall-related emergency room visit.</p>
