    <article class="prose">

      <p><strong>Yes, Medicare Advantage covers a hospital bed for home use as durable medical equipment (DME) when your doctor documents that it is medically necessary.</strong> The bed is typically rented and delivered to your home at no extra charge for setup. After 13 months of continuous rental, it becomes yours to keep. You do need to meet specific medical criteria, and you must use an in-network DME supplier, but for people recovering from surgery or managing a chronic condition, this benefit can make a real difference in comfort and safety at home.</p>

      <h2>Conditions That Qualify for a Home Hospital Bed</h2>
      <p>Your doctor must document why a standard bed is not adequate for your medical needs. Common conditions that qualify include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GERD or acid reflux:</strong> Elevating the head of the bed relieves nighttime symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart failure or congestive heart failure:</strong> Positioning helps with breathing and fluid management.</li>
        <li><strong>COPD or other respiratory conditions:</strong> An adjustable position can make breathing easier during sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Orthopedic recovery:</strong> Hip replacement, knee surgery, or back surgery recovery often requires a bed with positioning controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure injuries or wounds:</strong> Patients at risk for bedsores benefit from a bed that allows frequent repositioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuromuscular diseases:</strong> Conditions affecting mobility may require a bed that raises and lowers mechanically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key phrase your doctor needs to use is "medically necessary." A note saying the bed would be "helpful" or "more comfortable" is usually not enough to satisfy your plan's coverage criteria.</p>

      <h2>Types of Hospital Beds Medicare Advantage Covers</h2>
      <p>There are three main types of home hospital beds, and Medicare Advantage can cover all three depending on what your condition requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manual hospital bed:</strong> The head and foot sections are adjusted by hand using a crank. This is the most basic type and is covered for patients who need basic positioning but do not require frequent changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Semi-electric hospital bed:</strong> The head and foot sections are adjusted by electric controls, but the bed height is adjusted manually. This is the most commonly prescribed type.</li>
        <li><strong>Full-electric hospital bed:</strong> Head, foot, and bed height are all adjusted by remote control. This is typically covered for patients who have more severe limitations and cannot operate manual controls safely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your doctor's documentation should specify which type of bed is appropriate for your condition. The supplier cannot upgrade you to a more expensive bed without documentation supporting the need.</p>

      <h2>What Is Included with the Hospital Bed</h2>
      <p>When a hospital bed is delivered to your home, the DME supplier typically includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The bed frame and electric motor (if semi-electric or full-electric)</li>
        <li>A pressure-relieving mattress, which may be covered separately or included depending on your plan</li>
        <li>Setup and installation at no extra cost during the rental period</li>
        <li>Basic maintenance and repairs during the rental period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accessories like side rails and trapeze bars may also be covered as separate DME items if your doctor documents why they are needed. A trapeze bar, for example, helps patients reposition themselves in bed, which is often necessary after certain surgeries. Ask your doctor to address these accessories in the same letter of medical necessity.</p>

      <h2>The Rental and Ownership Timeline</h2>
      <p>Medicare Advantage uses a capped rental model for home hospital beds. Here is how the timeline works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your plan pays the supplier a monthly rental fee for up to 13 months.</li>
        <li>You pay your plan's cost-sharing each month, which may be a copay, coinsurance, or deductible amount depending on your plan.</li>
        <li>After 13 months of continuous rental, ownership transfers to you at no additional cost.</li>
        <li>For the first 6 months after you take ownership, your supplier is still required to service and maintain the bed if needed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you are discharged from a hospital or skilled nursing facility and need a hospital bed at home, the rental can begin right away. Your discharge planner or social worker can often help coordinate this before you leave the facility.</p>

      <h2>How to Get a Hospital Bed Covered</h2>
      <p>The process is straightforward when you know the steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Talk to your doctor about why a standard bed is not meeting your medical needs.</li>
        <li>Ask your doctor to write a prescription and a letter of medical necessity that names the specific type of bed required.</li>
        <li>Call your Medicare Advantage plan to ask about prior authorization requirements and get a list of in-network DME suppliers.</li>
        <li>Contact an approved supplier. Many will contact your doctor directly to gather the paperwork.</li>
        <li>Confirm delivery, setup, and your cost-sharing amount before agreeing to the rental.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What Medicare Advantage Does Not Cover</h2>
      <p>There are a few things to be aware of. A hospital bed is not covered simply because sleeping in a regular bed is uncomfortable. There must be a documented medical reason. The plan will not cover specialty mattresses like air-fluidized beds (used for severe wounds) under the standard DME benefit. Those may require a separate clinical review. You also cannot buy the bed outright and then seek reimbursement. The rental arrangement through an in-network supplier is required for coverage to apply.</p>
