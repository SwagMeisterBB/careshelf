    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>The biggest difference between Medicare Advantage and Original Medicare comes down to supplemental benefits. Original Medicare covers hospitalization and medical services, but it does not pay for routine dental care, vision, <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-hearing-aids.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">hearing aids</a>, over-the-counter health products, home safety modifications, or fitness programs. Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover everything Original Medicare covers, and most plans layer on a significant set of extra benefits that can be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year. This guide walks through each benefit category side by side so you can see exactly what each option includes.</p>

      <h2>What Is Original Medicare?</h2>
      <p>Original Medicare is the federal health insurance program managed directly by the U.S. government. It has two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Part A (Hospital Insurance):</strong> Covers inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care after a qualifying hospital stay, hospice, and some home health care.</li>
        <li><strong>Part B (Medical Insurance):</strong> Covers doctor visits, outpatient services, preventive care, durable medical equipment, and some home health care.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One important advantage of Original Medicare is provider flexibility. You can see any doctor, specialist, or hospital in the United States that accepts Medicare, without needing a referral or worrying about whether a provider is in-network. This is especially valuable for people who travel frequently or live in rural areas with limited provider options.</p>

      <h2>What Is Medicare Advantage?</h2>
      <p>Medicare Advantage (also called Part C) is an alternative way to receive your Medicare coverage. Instead of getting your benefits directly from the federal government, you enroll in a private insurance plan that is approved by Medicare. The plan must cover everything Part A and Part B cover, and most plans include additional benefits beyond the basics.</p>
      <p>Medicare Advantage plans typically operate as HMO or PPO networks, which means you generally need to use in-network providers and, in HMO plans, get referrals to see specialists. This is the main trade-off compared to Original Medicare. In exchange for accepting a network, most members gain access to a range of supplemental benefits not available under Original Medicare.</p>

      <h2>Supplemental Benefits That Medicare Advantage Plans Commonly Add</h2>

      <p><strong>Dental coverage.</strong> Most Medicare Advantage plans include some level of routine dental coverage, such as annual cleanings, X-rays, and fillings. Higher-value plans may cover more extensive work including crowns, extractions, and dentures, typically up to an annual maximum.</p>

      <p><strong>Vision coverage.</strong> Most plans include an annual eye exam and an allowance toward eyeglasses frames or contact lenses. The frame allowance typically ranges from $100 to $300 per year.</p>

      <p><strong>Hearing benefits.</strong> Many Medicare Advantage plans include hearing exams and a hearing aid benefit. Hearing aids sold through Original Medicare require you to pay the full cost, which can reach several thousand dollars per device.</p>

      <p><strong>OTC allowance.</strong> One of the most practical supplemental benefits is the OTC allowance, which gives members a quarterly budget ($50 to $200 in most plans) to spend on over-the-counter health products like blood pressure monitors, compression socks, vitamins, and pain relief products. Original Medicare does not cover any of these items.</p>

      <p><strong>Home safety modifications.</strong> Many plans provide an annual allowance ($200 to $500 is common) for home safety items like grab bars, threshold ramps, and non-slip mats. These modifications meaningfully reduce fall risk, which is one of the most serious health threats for people over 65.</p>

      <p><strong>Fitness benefits.</strong> Programs like SilverSneakers give members free or discounted gym access. Original Medicare does not include any fitness benefit.</p>

      <p><strong>Transportation.</strong> Some plans include a limited number of one-way trips to medical appointments per year, which is helpful for members who no longer drive.</p>

      <h2>The Main Trade-Off: Provider Networks</h2>
      <p>The most significant limitation of Medicare Advantage compared to Original Medicare is the provider network. Under Original Medicare, you can see any doctor or specialist in the country who accepts Medicare. Under most Medicare Advantage plans, you are limited to a network of providers in your area. Going outside the network typically means higher costs or no coverage at all in HMO plans.</p>
      <p>For people who receive care at major research hospitals or who see specialists across multiple health systems, this network restriction can be a meaningful disadvantage. However, for people who receive most of their care locally from a primary care doctor and a small set of specialists, the network restriction rarely causes problems in practice.</p>

      <h2>If You Are Already on Medicare Advantage, Use Your Benefits</h2>
      <p>If you are already enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, the supplemental benefits described above are available to you now. Many members do not realize how much their plan covers or do not know how to access benefits like the OTC allowance, home safety modifications, or hearing aids. These benefits have annual limits and reset dates, and unused funds are forfeited when the period ends.</p>
