    <article class="prose">

      <p>Many Humana Medicare Advantage plans include a home safety benefit that pays for modifications designed to reduce your fall risk at home. Most plans that include this benefit provide between <strong>$0 and $500 per year</strong> for items like <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-grab-bars.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">grab bars</a>, threshold ramps, non-slip mats, and toilet safety rails. This is one of the most valuable supplemental benefits available in Medicare Advantage because it helps you stay independent at home while reducing the risk of a serious injury.</p>

      <div class="my-6 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-5">
        <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-1">Important Disclaimer</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Benefits vary by specific Humana plan and county. Not all Humana plans include a home safety benefit. Always call Humana Member Services at <strong>1-800-457-4708</strong> to confirm whether your specific plan includes this benefit, how much the allowance is, and what the approved process is for using it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is the Humana Home Safety Benefit?</h2>
      <p>The home safety benefit, sometimes called a home modification benefit, is a supplemental benefit that Humana includes in select Medicare Advantage plans. It provides an annual allowance you can use to purchase or install safety equipment in your home. The goal of this benefit is to help you age in place safely by reducing the physical hazards that lead to falls, which are one of the most common causes of injury and hospitalization for adults 65 and older.</p>
      <p>Falls often happen in predictable places: the bathroom, near stairs, and on uneven thresholds. The home safety benefit is specifically designed to address these risks by funding practical modifications in those areas.</p>

      <h2>What Does the Humana Home Safety Benefit Cover?</h2>
      <p>While the exact covered items depend on your specific plan, many Humana home safety benefits cover some or all of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grab bars:</strong> Installation in the shower, bathtub, and near the toilet</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold ramps:</strong> Small ramps over door thresholds to eliminate trip hazards</li>
        <li><strong>Toilet safety rails and raised toilet seats:</strong> For easier standing and sitting</li>
        <li><strong>Non-slip mats and treads:</strong> For the bathroom floor and shower</li>
        <li><strong>Stair handrails and banister supports</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Shower chairs and bath seats</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Doorway widening:</strong> In some higher-value plans, to accommodate mobility aids</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Installation labor costs may or may not be covered depending on your plan. Some plans cover only the products themselves, while others include a contractor allowance for installation. Be sure to ask about this when you call Member Services.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does the Benefit Provide?</h2>
      <p>The annual allowance for Humana's home safety benefit typically ranges from <strong>$0 to $500 per year</strong>, depending on your specific plan and where you live. Higher-value plans in certain markets may offer more. The benefit resets on January 1 each year, and unused funds are forfeited at year-end. If your plan includes this benefit, it makes sense to use it during the plan year rather than waiting.</p>

      <h2>How to Use Your Humana Home Safety Benefit</h2>
      <p>The process for using your home safety benefit depends on your specific plan, but here are the general steps most Humana members follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Call Humana Member Services at 1-800-457-4708.</strong> Ask specifically about your "home safety benefit" or "home modification benefit." Confirm the dollar amount and the approved process for your plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask about the vendor list.</strong> Some Humana plans require you to use an approved network of home modification contractors. Others allow you to self-purchase items and submit for reimbursement with a receipt.</li>
        <li><strong>Get the details in writing if possible.</strong> Ask the representative to send you a letter or email confirming your benefit amount and the approved items or vendors.</li>
        <li><strong>Make your purchases or schedule your contractor.</strong> Follow the approved process for your plan to ensure reimbursement goes smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Submit receipts if required.</strong> If your plan uses a reimbursement model, submit your itemized receipts to Humana within the required timeframe.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>When Does the Home Safety Benefit Reset?</h2>
      <p>The Humana home safety benefit resets on <strong>January 1</strong> each year. Unused funds from the previous year do not carry over. If you are approaching the end of the plan year and have not used your home safety allowance, now is the time to act. Even a simple grab bar installation can make a meaningful difference in fall prevention, and if your plan covers it, there is no reason to leave that benefit unused.</p>

      <h2>Why Home Safety Modifications Matter</h2>
      <p>Falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency room visits among older adults. The bathroom is the most common location for falls in the home, which is why grab bars, non-slip mats, and <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-shower-chair.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">shower chair</a>s are so important. A threshold ramp that costs $50 to $120 can eliminate a trip hazard that might otherwise lead to a broken hip and a hospital stay. When your plan pays for these items, using the benefit is simply smart planning.</p>
      <p>Even if you feel steady on your feet today, adding safety modifications now is much easier than doing so after an injury. Caregivers helping a parent or loved one navigate their plan should make the home safety benefit one of the first things they look into.</p>

      <h2>Getting the Most from Your Humana Plan</h2>
      <p>The home safety benefit is just one of several supplemental benefits Humana Medicare Advantage plans commonly include. Many plans also offer an OTC allowance for health products, dental and vision coverage, hearing aid benefits, and fitness perks. Use AdvantageGuide to get a full picture of what your specific Humana plan covers and clear instructions on how to claim each benefit before it resets.</p>
