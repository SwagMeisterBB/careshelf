    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>Yes, many Medicare Advantage plans include dental benefits. This is a significant difference from Original Medicare, which does not cover routine dental care at all. If your plan includes dental coverage, you can use it for cleanings, exams, x-rays, and in many cases more extensive work like fillings, extractions, crowns, and dentures. The specific services covered and the dollar limits depend on your individual plan.</p>

      <h2>Why Original Medicare Does Not Cover Dental</h2>
      <p>Original Medicare (Parts A and B) was created to cover hospital care and physician services. Routine dental care was not included when the program was established, and that has not changed. The one exception is dental care that is directly tied to a covered medical procedure, such as tooth extraction before heart surgery. Outside of those narrow situations, Medicare pays nothing for dental care. Medicare Advantage plans fill this gap by offering dental as a supplemental benefit.</p>

      <h2>What Dental Services Are Usually Covered?</h2>
      <p>Most Medicare Advantage dental benefits are divided into three tiers. Coverage and cost-sharing differ at each level:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preventive care:</strong> Routine cleanings (usually two per year), dental exams, and x-rays are typically covered at low or no cost when you use an in-network dentist. These services are designed to catch problems early before they become expensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic restorative care:</strong> Fillings and simple tooth extractions usually come with a copay after you visit an in-network dentist. The plan typically covers a set percentage of the cost, such as 50 to 80 percent.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive care:</strong> Crowns, root canals, dentures, and bridges are often covered, but with higher copays or only up to an annual dollar maximum. Some plans cover these services only after a waiting period of six to twelve months from your enrollment date.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Annual maximum benefit amounts typically range from <strong>$1,000 to $2,000</strong> per year. Once you reach that maximum, you pay 100 percent of additional dental costs for the rest of the year. A few higher-tier plans offer benefits up to $3,000 or more.</p>

      <h2>In-Network vs. Out-of-Network Dentists</h2>
      <p>Most Medicare Advantage dental benefits require you to use an in-network dentist to receive full coverage. If you go to a dentist outside the network, your plan may pay a reduced amount or nothing at all, depending on whether your plan has a PPO or HMO structure. Before scheduling any dental appointment, confirm the dentist is in your plan's network.</p>
      <p>To find an in-network dentist, call the Member Services number on the back of your insurance card or log into your member portal. You can search by zip code, specialty, or language spoken. You can also ask the dental office directly whether they accept your plan before your appointment.</p>

      <h2>Do Some Plans Offer Separate Dental Riders?</h2>
      <p>Some Medicare Advantage plans offer an optional dental rider, which is an add-on benefit you can purchase for an additional monthly premium. A rider may provide higher annual maximums or coverage for services not included in the base plan. If your current plan has a limited dental benefit, ask Member Services whether a dental rider is available and what it costs.</p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Use Your Dental Benefit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Call Member Services and confirm your plan includes dental coverage. Ask for the annual maximum benefit, what services are covered, and whether there is a waiting period for comprehensive services.</li>
        <li>Find an in-network dentist using your plan's provider directory online or by calling Member Services.</li>
        <li>Schedule your appointment and let the front desk know you have Medicare Advantage coverage. Give them your plan name and member ID number.</li>
        <li>Before any major procedure, ask the dental office to get a pre-authorization or cost estimate from your plan. This tells you exactly what the plan will pay and what you will owe.</li>
        <li>Bring your insurance card to each appointment. Pay your copay at the time of service and review the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) your plan sends afterward.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Use Your Dental Benefit Every Year</h2>
      <p>This is one of the most important points: <strong>unused dental benefits do not roll over</strong> in most Medicare Advantage plans. If your plan gives you $1,500 of dental coverage per year and you only use $300, you lose the remaining $1,200 when the benefit year resets. Getting your two preventive cleanings and annual exam each year costs the plan very little but helps you catch problems before they require expensive treatment.</p>
      <p>Schedule your cleanings at the beginning of the year so you have time to address any issues found before the annual maximum resets. If your dentist identifies a crown or other comprehensive work, you may be able to split the treatment across two benefit years to stay under the annual maximum.</p>

      <h2>What If Your Plan Has Limited Dental Coverage?</h2>
      <p>If your current plan only covers preventive care or has a low annual maximum, you have options. During the Annual Enrollment Period (October 15 to December 7), you can switch to a Medicare Advantage plan with richer dental benefits. Compare plans at Medicare.gov or speak with a licensed insurance agent who can show you plans available in your area.</p>
      <p>You can also use a standalone dental discount plan to supplement limited coverage. These are not insurance but membership programs that negotiate lower fees with participating dentists. They can reduce out-of-pocket costs for services your plan does not fully cover.</p>

      <h2>Oral Health and Overall Health</h2>
      <p>Dental health is closely connected to overall health, particularly for older adults. Untreated gum disease has been linked to heart disease, diabetes complications, and respiratory infections. Using your dental benefit regularly is not just about your teeth. It is an investment in your overall health and quality of life. If cost or transportation has been a barrier to dental care, talk to your plan about whether transportation benefits or telehealth dental consultations are available.</p>
