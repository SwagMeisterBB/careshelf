    <p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by AdvantageGuide Editorial Team</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>Yes, many Medicare Advantage plans cover hearing aids as a supplemental benefit. This is one of the most meaningful differences between Medicare Advantage and Original Medicare. Original Medicare (Parts A and B) does not cover hearing aids at all. If your Medicare Advantage plan includes a hearing benefit, you could receive significant help paying for the cost of hearing aids, which can run several thousand dollars out of pocket without coverage.</p>

      <h2>Why Original Medicare Does Not Cover Hearing Aids</h2>
      <p>Original Medicare was designed to cover acute medical care, hospitalizations, and physician services. Hearing aids fall into the category of supplemental benefits, which Congress did not include in the original program. As a result, millions of older adults pay entirely out of pocket for hearing devices every year. Medicare Advantage plans are allowed to offer supplemental benefits beyond what Original Medicare covers, and hearing is one of the most commonly included extras.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does Medicare Advantage Pay for Hearing Aids?</h2>
      <p>The dollar amount varies by plan and by year. Most plans with hearing coverage pay somewhere between <strong>$500 and $2,000 per ear</strong> per benefit period. The benefit period is typically one year or two years, depending on your plan. That means if you need two hearing aids, your plan might contribute $1,000 to $4,000 toward the purchase.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for any cost above the plan's benefit amount. If your plan pays $1,000 per ear and you choose a hearing aid that costs $1,800 per ear, you pay the $800 difference out of pocket. In-network providers often carry a range of devices at or near the covered benefit amount so you can get hearing aids at little or no additional cost.</p>

      <h2>Do You Have to Use Specific Providers?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Almost all Medicare Advantage hearing benefits require you to use in-network audiologists or hearing aid providers. Some plans contract directly with individual audiologists in your area. Others use a national third-party hearing network. Common networks include TruHearing, UnitedHearing, and Hearing Care Solutions. Your plan's Member Services line or member portal will tell you which network applies to your plan and how to find a provider near you.</p>
      <p>If you go outside the network, your plan will likely pay nothing toward the cost of hearing aids. Always confirm a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.</p>

      <h2>Are Hearing Exams Covered Separately?</h2>
      <p>In most cases, yes. Hearing evaluations and fittings are typically covered separately from the hearing aid benefit itself. Your plan may cover a routine hearing exam once per year at low or no cost. This exam helps determine whether you have hearing loss and what type of hearing aid would work best for you. Ask your plan specifically about the cost of the exam so you are not surprised by a bill.</p>

      <h2>What About Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids?</h2>
      <p>Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids became available without a prescription in 2022 for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. Some Medicare Advantage plans allow you to use your OTC benefit allowance to purchase OTC hearing aids from an approved catalog. This is a separate pathway from the traditional hearing aid benefit. If your plan has an OTC allowance, check the approved item list to see if OTC hearing devices are included. The OTC benefit is usually a quarterly or annual dollar amount you can spend on approved health products.</p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Use Your Hearing Benefit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Call Member Services on the back of your insurance card and ask: "Does my plan include a hearing aid benefit?" Ask for the dollar amount per ear and how often the benefit renews.</li>
        <li>Ask for the name of the hearing network your plan uses, or request a list of in-network audiologists near you.</li>
        <li>Schedule a hearing evaluation with an in-network provider. Bring your insurance card and confirm coverage before the appointment.</li>
        <li>Review the hearing aid options available through your in-network provider. Ask which devices are fully covered versus which ones require out-of-pocket cost.</li>
        <li>Get fitted for hearing aids and follow up as directed. Most providers include follow-up adjustments in the initial fitting cost.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips to Get the Most from Your Hearing Benefit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use your benefit every benefit period. Unused hearing benefits do not roll over in most plans.</li>
        <li>Ask your provider about battery costs, warranty, and follow-up visits. These details vary by device and provider.</li>
        <li>If you are also enrolled in a plan with an OTC benefit, check whether OTC hearing aids appear on your approved item list.</li>
        <li>If your current plan does not include hearing coverage, you can shop for a different Medicare Advantage plan during the Annual Enrollment Period (October 15 to December 7 each year).</li>
        <li>Some plans offer discounts at national hearing centers even if they do not cover the full cost of hearing aids. Ask Member Services about any discount programs available to you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What If Your Plan Does Not Cover Hearing Aids?</h2>
      <p>Not every Medicare Advantage plan includes hearing coverage. If yours does not, you have a few options. You can compare plans during the next enrollment period and look for one that includes a hearing benefit. You can also look into state-based programs, Veterans Affairs benefits if you qualify, or community health programs that assist with hearing aid costs. Some hearing aid manufacturers offer financing or reduced-cost programs directly to consumers.</p>
      <p>Hearing loss that goes untreated is associated with social isolation, cognitive decline, and safety risks. If you have been putting off addressing hearing loss because of cost, check your current plan benefits before assuming coverage is not available.</p>
