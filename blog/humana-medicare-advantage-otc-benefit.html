    <article class="prose">

      <p>If you have a Humana Medicare Advantage plan, you very likely have an over-the-counter (OTC) benefit that gives you a quarterly allowance to spend on everyday health products at no cost to you. Most Humana Medicare Advantage plans include an OTC benefit ranging from <strong>$25 to $200 per quarter</strong>, depending on your specific plan and where you live. This guide explains exactly how to check your balance, where to use it, and what you can buy.</p>

      <div class="my-6 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-5">
        <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-1">Important Disclaimer</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Benefits vary by specific Humana plan and location. The information below reflects common features across many Humana plans, but your plan may differ. Always call Humana Member Services at <strong>1-800-457-4708</strong> or log into MyHumana at humana.com to confirm your exact benefit amount and covered items.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is the Humana OTC Benefit?</h2>
      <p>The OTC benefit is a prepaid allowance that Humana loads onto a dedicated card each quarter. You use that card like a debit card at approved stores or online to buy eligible health and wellness products. The benefit is separate from your regular Humana insurance card, so make sure you have both. Items you buy with OTC funds cost you nothing out of pocket as long as they fall within the covered list and your available balance.</p>
      <p>This benefit is one of the most popular supplemental perks in Medicare Advantage plans because it covers everyday items you would normally pay for yourself, such as blood pressure monitors, vitamins, compression socks, dental care products, and more.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does Humana Give for OTC?</h2>
      <p>Most Humana Medicare Advantage plans provide between <strong>$25 and $200 per quarter</strong> in OTC funds. That works out to $100 to $800 per year. The exact amount depends on your specific plan and the county you live in. Some higher-value plans offer more. The allowance resets every quarter on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1. Any unused balance at the end of the quarter is forfeited and does not roll over, so it pays to use your funds before the deadline.</p>

      <h2>How to Check Your Humana OTC Balance</h2>
      <p>There are two easy ways to check how much OTC money you have available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Call Member Services:</strong> Dial 1-800-457-4708 and follow the prompts to check your OTC balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Log into MyHumana:</strong> Go to humana.com, sign in to your member account, and look for the OTC or supplemental benefits section on your dashboard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Checking your balance before you shop is a good habit, especially as you approach the end of a quarter. That way you can make sure you use your full allowance before it resets.</p>

      <h2>Where Can You Use Your Humana OTC Card In-Store?</h2>
      <p>Humana's OTC card works at a wide network of retail stores. Common approved locations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walmart</li>
        <li>Walgreens</li>
        <li>CVS Pharmacy</li>
        <li>Dollar General</li>
        <li>Rite Aid (in some markets)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you shop in person, bring your Humana OTC card with you. At checkout, hand the cashier the OTC card or swipe it yourself. It works just like a debit card. Only eligible items will be approved by the system. If you mix eligible and ineligible items in the same transaction, the card will cover only the eligible ones and you pay the difference for the rest.</p>

      <h2>How to Order OTC Items Online Through Humana</h2>
      <p>Humana also allows members to order OTC products online and have them shipped to your home at no extra charge. To place an online order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log into your MyHumana account at humana.com.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the OTC benefits or supplemental benefits section.</li>
        <li>Browse the catalog of eligible items.</li>
        <li>Add items to your cart and check out using your OTC allowance.</li>
        <li>Your order ships to your home, typically within a few business days.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Online ordering is convenient if you have difficulty getting to a store or prefer to shop from home. The catalog includes many of the same products available in retail stores.</p>

      <h2>What Does the Humana OTC Benefit Cover?</h2>
      <p>The covered item list varies by plan, but most Humana OTC benefits include products in these categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health monitoring:</strong> Blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, thermometers</li>
        <li><strong>First aid:</strong> Bandages, antiseptics, wound care</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamins and supplements:</strong> Multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium</li>
        <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Toothbrushes, toothpaste, denture adhesive, mouthwash</li>
        <li><strong>Eye care:</strong> Reading glasses, eye drops, lens cleaning supplies</li>
        <li><strong>Incontinence supplies:</strong> Pads, protective underwear</li>
        <li><strong>Compression socks and garments</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pain relief:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers, TENS units, hot and cold packs</li>
        <li><strong>Foot care:</strong> Insoles, foot creams, nail care</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always confirm that a specific product is eligible before you buy. The OTC card will decline at checkout if an item is not on the approved list.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Get the Most From Your Humana OTC Benefit</h2>
      <p>A few simple habits can help you use every dollar of your quarterly allowance. First, set a reminder on your calendar for the last week of each quarter (end of March, June, September, and December) so you remember to shop before the reset. Second, make a list of health items you regularly buy and check whether they qualify. Third, consider stocking up on non-perishable items like vitamins, first aid supplies, and compression socks so nothing goes to waste. Finally, use AdvantageGuide to quickly identify which specific products your Humana plan covers and get step-by-step instructions for claiming them.</p>
