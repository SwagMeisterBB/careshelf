    <article class="prose">

      <p><strong>Yes, Medicare Advantage covers CPAP machines as durable medical equipment (DME) when you have a documented sleep apnea diagnosis from a sleep study.</strong> Your plan pays for the machine, and in most cases you rent it for 13 months and then own it outright. Supplies like masks, filters, and tubing are also covered, either through your DME benefit or your plan's OTC allowance. There are a few requirements to meet, and you must use an in-network supplier, but the process is straightforward once your doctor has the right paperwork in place.</p>

      <h2>Who Qualifies for CPAP Coverage</h2>
      <p>To get a CPAP covered, you need a formal sleep apnea diagnosis backed by a sleep study. Medicare and Medicare Advantage follow the same clinical thresholds. You qualify if your sleep study shows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 15 or more events per hour, regardless of symptoms, or</li>
        <li>An AHI of 5 to 14 events per hour <strong>plus</strong> documented symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia, high blood pressure, or a history of stroke or heart disease.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The sleep study can be done in a lab (polysomnography) or at home using a home sleep apnea test. Your doctor will review the results and write a prescription that documents your diagnosis and the medical necessity for CPAP therapy.</p>

      <h2>How the 13-Month Rental Process Works</h2>
      <p>Medicare Advantage covers CPAP machines through a rental arrangement rather than an outright purchase. Here is how it typically works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your doctor writes a prescription and documents medical necessity.</li>
        <li>You choose an in-network DME supplier. Your plan's website or member services line can give you a list.</li>
        <li>The supplier delivers the machine and walks you through setup.</li>
        <li>Your plan pays the supplier a monthly rental fee. You pay your plan's cost-sharing (usually a copay or coinsurance after your deductible).</li>
        <li>After 13 months of continuous rental, ownership transfers to you automatically.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>One important detail: your plan may require you to show that the therapy is working before it continues coverage past the first few months. Most plans check in around the 90-day mark to confirm you are using the machine at least 4 hours per night on 70% of nights. Your CPAP machine records this data automatically, so compliance is easy to document.</p>

      <h2>Prior Authorization: What to Expect</h2>
      <p>Many Medicare Advantage plans require prior authorization before they will cover a CPAP machine. This means the plan reviews your doctor's documentation before approving coverage. Prior authorization is not a denial. It is simply a review step. Your DME supplier and doctor's office usually handle this paperwork together. If your plan requires it, expect a few extra days before the machine is delivered. Ask your supplier upfront whether prior authorization is needed so there are no surprises.</p>

      <h2>Are CPAP Supplies Covered Too?</h2>
      <p>Yes, CPAP supplies are covered, and this is good news because masks, filters, tubing, and headgear wear out over time. Here is how coverage typically works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Through your DME benefit:</strong> Replacement supplies can be ordered from your in-network DME supplier on a set schedule. For example, Medicare generally covers a new mask every 3 months, new filters every 1 to 2 months, and new tubing every 3 months.</li>
        <li><strong>Through your OTC allowance:</strong> Some Medicare Advantage plans include CPAP supplies like filters and chin straps in their over-the-counter allowance. Check your plan's OTC catalog to see what is listed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Keep track of your supply schedule and reorder when you are eligible. Worn-out masks and dirty filters reduce how well your therapy works, so staying on top of replacements matters.</p>

      <h2>Using an In-Network Supplier</h2>
      <p>This is one of the most common mistakes people make. If you buy or rent a CPAP machine from a supplier that is not in your plan's network, you may pay full price or significantly more. Always call your plan's member services line before ordering to confirm the supplier is in-network. Large national DME companies are often in-network with many plans, but it is worth verifying each time. Your doctor's office may also be able to refer you to a preferred supplier.</p>

      <h2>What If Your CPAP Machine Needs Repair?</h2>
      <p>During the 13-month rental period, your DME supplier is responsible for maintenance and repairs at no extra charge to you. If the machine breaks or malfunctions, contact your supplier first. They are required to service it or provide a replacement. After you take ownership at month 13, you become responsible for repairs, though your plan may still cover some maintenance costs. Check your Evidence of Coverage document for details specific to your plan.</p>

      <h2>BiPAP and APAP Machines: Are They Covered?</h2>
      <p>BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) and APAP (auto-adjusting positive airway pressure) machines are also covered as DME, but the qualification requirements are slightly stricter for BiPAP. BiPAP is typically reserved for patients who cannot tolerate standard CPAP pressure or who have other breathing conditions like COPD alongside their sleep apnea. Your doctor will determine which type of machine is appropriate based on your diagnosis and symptoms.</p>

      <h2>Steps to Get Your CPAP Covered</h2>
      <p>Here is a quick checklist to make the process go smoothly:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ask your primary care doctor for a referral to a sleep specialist or request a home sleep apnea test.</li>
        <li>Complete the sleep study and get your results.</li>
        <li>Have your doctor write a prescription and letter of medical necessity.</li>
        <li>Call your Medicare Advantage plan to ask about prior authorization requirements and get a list of in-network DME suppliers.</li>
        <li>Contact an in-network supplier and provide your prescription.</li>
        <li>Confirm your delivery date and cost-sharing amount before accepting the equipment.</li>
        <li>Use the machine consistently so your plan can confirm compliance at the 90-day check-in.</li>
      </ol>
