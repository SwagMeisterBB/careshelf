    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>Many Medicare Advantage benefits reset on January 1 and any unused balance is simply forfeited. That means unused <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-dental.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">dental</a> allowances, unspent OTC credits, and unclaimed home safety dollars disappear at midnight on December 31 every year. If you haven't used all of your benefits by late fall, now is the time to act.</p>

      <h2>Why Benefits Expire at Year End</h2>
      <p>Medicare Advantage plans design most supplemental benefits on an annual cycle. This applies to the OTC allowance, dental annual maximum, <a href="/blog/does-medicare-advantage-cover-glasses-vision.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">vision</a> frame allowance, hearing benefit, and home safety allowance. These benefits are built into the premium you pay each month, so leaving them unused means you paid for something you never received.</p>
      <p>The fourth quarter (October through December) is the best time to do a full benefits review. Dental offices fill up quickly in December, so scheduling early gives you a better chance of getting an appointment before the year ends.</p>

      <h2>Benefits That Expire on December 31</h2>
      <p>These benefits typically do not carry over to the next plan year. If you haven't used them fully, they are gone after December 31:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OTC quarterly balance:</strong> If you have any remaining Q4 OTC credit, spend it before the quarter ends. Unused quarterly balances do not roll over to the next quarter or the next year.</li>
        <li><strong>Home safety or home modification allowance:</strong> This annual benefit, which often covers grab bars, ramps, and non-slip mats, resets each January 1. Any unused portion of your annual allowance is forfeited.</li>
        <li><strong>Dental annual maximum:</strong> Most dental benefits cap covered services at an annual dollar amount. If you need dental work and haven't reached your maximum, scheduling before December 31 means the cost counts against the current year's limit, not next year's.</li>
        <li><strong>Vision frame and contact lens allowance:</strong> Your annual vision benefit, including any allowance for frames or contact lenses, typically expires at year end. If you haven't had your annual eye exam or used your frame allowance, do it now.</li>
        <li><strong>Hearing benefit:</strong> If your plan includes a hearing exam or an allowance toward hearing aids on an annual basis, this benefit resets with the plan year.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits That Do NOT Expire at Year End</h2>
      <p>Not every benefit works on an annual cycle. These benefits are available year-round and are not affected by December 31:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Durable medical equipment (DME):</strong> Coverage for items like walkers, wheelchairs, and hospital beds is not capped annually. It is available whenever medical necessity is established, regardless of the time of year.</li>
        <li><strong>Home health visits:</strong> Skilled nursing visits, physical therapy at home, and occupational therapy at home are covered as long as you meet the homebound criteria and a doctor orders the services. There is no annual visit limit that resets.</li>
        <li><strong>Part A and Part B benefits:</strong> Standard hospital coverage and outpatient medical coverage do not have annual expiration deadlines for most services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Q4 Benefits Checklist</h2>
      <p>Use this checklist in the last quarter of the year to make sure you haven't left anything behind:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Check your OTC balance.</strong> Call Member Services or log into your plan portal and ask how much OTC credit you have remaining in Q4. Place an order for eligible health items before the quarter ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule a dental appointment.</strong> If you have remaining dental benefit, schedule a cleaning, X-rays, or any needed work before December 31. Call your dental office now because appointment slots fill up.</li>
        <li><strong>Get your annual eye exam.</strong> If you haven't had an eye exam this year, schedule one. If your plan includes an allowance for new glasses or contacts, use it before the year ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Check your home safety allowance.</strong> Call Member Services and ask: "How much of my home safety or home modification benefit have I used this year? How much is remaining?" If you have unused allowance, consider purchasing grab bars, a non-slip bath mat, or other safety items.</li>
        <li><strong>Get your annual hearing exam.</strong> If your plan includes a hearing benefit, schedule a hearing test and ask about any allowance toward hearing aids.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How to Check Each Balance</h2>
      <p>The most reliable way to check any benefit balance is to call the Member Services number on the back of your plan card. Ask specifically: "How much of my [benefit name] benefit have I used this year, and how much is remaining?" For the <a href="/blog/what-is-medicare-advantage-otc-benefit.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">OTC benefit</a>, you can also <a href="/blog/how-to-check-medicare-advantage-otc-balance.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">check your balance</a> through your plan's online portal or call the OTC benefit phone number on your card.</p>
      <p>For dental and vision, your provider's office can often tell you how much of your benefit you've used when you schedule an appointment. Always confirm with your plan directly if you're unsure.</p>

      <h2>What Happens If You Miss the Deadline</h2>
      <p>If December 31 passes and you haven't used a benefit, the allowance is gone. Plans do not offer extensions or rollover credits for missed benefits. The new plan year starts fresh on January 1, and any benefit you have access to in the new year is available from that date forward.</p>
      <p>The good news: if you missed your benefits this year, you can start fresh in January and make a plan to use every benefit before the year ends. Many people set calendar reminders in October to review their benefits each fall.</p>

      <h2>Leaving Benefits Unused Is Leaving Money Behind</h2>
      <p>Your Medicare Advantage premium is partly what funds your supplemental benefits. Whether your premium is $0 or $200 per month, those benefits are built into the cost of the plan. Not using them doesn't lower your premium. It simply means you paid for coverage you didn't receive.</p>
      <p>Taking 30 minutes in Q4 to review your benefits and make a few phone calls can easily save you $200 to $500 in out-of-pocket costs. That's a worthwhile investment of your time.</p>
