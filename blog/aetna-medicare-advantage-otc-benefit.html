    <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-10">Published March 1, 2026 by Austin Edy</p>
    <article class="prose">

      <p>Aetna Medicare Advantage plans, now part of CVS Health, include an <a href="/blog/what-is-medicare-advantage-otc-benefit.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">OTC benefit</a> in most markets that gives members a quarterly allowance to buy everyday health products at no cost. Most Aetna Medicare Advantage plans provide between <strong>$25 and $150 per quarter</strong> in OTC funds, with a natural advantage at CVS stores due to the CVS Health connection. This guide explains how your Aetna OTC benefit works, where you can use it, and how to get the most out of every dollar.</p>

      <div class="my-6 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-5">
        <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-1">Important Disclaimer</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Benefits vary by specific Aetna plan and location. The information below reflects common features across many Aetna Medicare Advantage plans, but your plan may differ. Always log into your member portal at aetna.com or call Member Services at the number on the back of your Aetna card to confirm your exact benefit amount and covered items.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Is the Aetna OTC Benefit?</h2>
      <p>The OTC benefit is a prepaid quarterly allowance that Aetna loads onto your OTC benefit card. You use this card at approved retail stores or through Aetna's online ordering portal to purchase eligible health and wellness products. Because Aetna is part of CVS Health, Aetna members often find that CVS stores are a particularly convenient place to shop. The integration between Aetna and CVS can also make it easier to find eligible items, since CVS staff are generally familiar with how the benefit works.</p>
      <p>The benefit covers everyday items that Original Medicare does not pay for, such as blood pressure monitors, vitamins, compression socks, dental supplies, and more. Using this benefit is one of the simplest ways to reduce your out-of-pocket spending on health essentials each quarter.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does Aetna Give for OTC?</h2>
      <p>Most Aetna Medicare Advantage plans provide between <strong>$25 and $150 per quarter</strong> in OTC allowance. Some plans may offer more, depending on the specific plan design and the county where you live. The allowance resets quarterly. Unused funds at the end of the quarter are forfeited and do not roll over to the next period, so it is worth shopping before each reset date.</p>

      <h2>How to Check Your Aetna OTC Balance</h2>
      <p>There are two easy ways to check your current OTC balance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Log into aetna.com:</strong> Sign in to your member account and navigate to the supplemental benefits or OTC benefit section of your dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Member Services:</strong> Use the phone number printed on the back of your Aetna insurance card. A representative can confirm your current balance and the reset schedule for your plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Checking your balance a week or two before the end of each quarter gives you enough time to shop and use any remaining funds before they expire.</p>

      <h2>Where Can You Use Your Aetna OTC Card In-Store?</h2>
      <p>Aetna's OTC card is accepted at a network of approved retail stores. Common locations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CVS Pharmacy (particularly well-integrated due to the CVS Health connection)</li>
        <li>Walmart</li>
        <li>Walgreens</li>
        <li>Dollar General (in many markets)</li>
        <li>Other approved retailers depending on your specific plan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At checkout, swipe or tap your Aetna OTC card like a debit card. The system automatically approves eligible items and flags ineligible ones. If your cart includes a mix of covered and non-covered products, pay for the ineligible items separately using another payment method.</p>

      <h2>Ordering OTC Items Online Through Aetna</h2>
      <p>Many Aetna plans also offer online OTC ordering through the member portal at aetna.com. Online ordering is a great option for members who prefer home delivery or have difficulty traveling to a store. Log into your account, navigate to the OTC benefit section, browse the eligible product catalog, and place your order. Items ship to your home, typically at no extra charge, within a few business days.</p>

      <h2>What Does the Aetna OTC Benefit Cover?</h2>
      <p>The exact list of covered items depends on your specific plan, but most Aetna OTC benefits include products in these categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health monitoring:</strong> Blood pressure monitors, thermometers, pulse oximeters</li>
        <li><strong>First aid:</strong> Bandages, wound care, antiseptic supplies</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamins and supplements:</strong> Multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, fish oil</li>
        <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, denture adhesive</li>
        <li><strong>Eye care:</strong> Reading glasses, lubricating drops, lens cleaning products</li>
        <li><strong>Foot care:</strong> Insoles, antifungal products, foot creams</li>
        <li><strong>Compression socks and support garments</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pain relief:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers, heating pads, cold packs</li>
        <li><strong>Incontinence supplies</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Non-slip bath mats and other safety items (in some plans)</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Aetna's Healthy Foods Benefit: An Extra Perk in Some Plans</h2>
      <p>Some Aetna Medicare Advantage plans also include a <strong>Healthy Foods benefit</strong> separate from the standard OTC allowance. This benefit provides funds specifically for purchasing nutritious groceries, including fresh produce, lean proteins, and whole grains, at participating grocery stores. If your plan includes this feature, the Healthy Foods funds may appear as a separate balance on your OTC card. Ask Member Services whether your plan includes a Healthy Foods allowance and how to use it.</p>

      <h2>Other Supplemental Benefits in Aetna Medicare Advantage Plans</h2>
      <p>Beyond the OTC benefit, Aetna Medicare Advantage plans commonly include several other supplemental benefits not covered by Original Medicare. These may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dental coverage for cleanings, X-rays, fillings, and sometimes crowns</li>
        <li>Vision coverage for eye exams and a frame or contact lens allowance</li>
        <li>Hearing coverage for hearing exams and hearing aids</li>
        <li>Home safety modifications such as grab bars and threshold ramps</li>
        <li>Transportation to medical appointments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The specific benefits available depend on your plan. Use AdvantageGuide to identify all the benefits your Aetna plan includes and get clear instructions on how to claim each one.</p>
